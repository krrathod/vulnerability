## Data Transmission Without Encryption
  Information sent over a network can be compromised while in transit. An attacker may be able to
 read or modify the contents if the data are sent in plaintext or are weakly encrypted. (HTTP to HTTPS)
 
 ##  Insufficient Session-ID Length
 If an attacker can guess or steal a session ID, then they may be able to take over the user's
session (called session hijacking). The number of possible session IDs increases with increased
session ID length, making it more difficult to guess or steal a session ID

## Missing Custom Error Page
A Web application must define a default error page for 4xx errors (e.g. 404), 5xx (e.g. 500) errors
and catch java.lang.Throwable exceptions to prevent attackers from mining information from the
application container's built-in error response.
When an attacker explores a web site looking for vulnerabilities, the amount of information that the
site provides is crucial to the eventual success or failure of any attempted attacks.


##  ASP.NET Misconfiguration: Password in Configuration File
Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to
the password-protected resource making them an easy target for attackers.
